Start the program by starting "ImageHive.exe"

In the "data" folder you can find several test data.
With some datasets the algorithm works better than others concerning clustering to 
similarity. data images as in the directory "unnatural" does not work very well with
similarity calculation than eg. natural datasets as "vacation"


If you want to try it with your own dataset keep in mind:
* .png are prefered 
* concerning calculation time: use small input images (no more than 250KB per image)
* right now more than 25 is not supported - at your own risk! :)


After start you can take a look at local clusters by clicking on them, and also 
can see saliency regions with "c" and click on the cluster.

Keep in mind to NOT close the big image, since it is not working probably after!

Have fun
